MindStorm
=========
Background:
Motivational speakers Earl Nightingale and Brian Tracy have advocated the use of a method that 
both have claimed a significant number of people have used to become millionaires.  
The method is rather simple, although not necessarily easy.  
One sits down with something to write with, and at the top of a blank piece of paper writes in question form 
a goal or problem that they wish to solve.  
Then one stretches one’s mind in whatever ways he or she can in order to generate a minimum of 21 answers to the question
one wrote at the top of the page.  
Brian Tracy has dubbed this process, “MindStorming,”, and alternately, “The 21 Idea Method.”   

The value of implementing the “MindStorm” process once for a single goal or problem is immediately obvious.  
One walks away from the completion of the exercise with 21 potential solutions.  
It may not be as obvious that a far greater set of benefits accrue when one makes this a regular practice.  
If a person were to practice this method every day for 30 days, 
at the end of the time they would have 630 ideas for how to achieve or solve 30 of their most important goals or problems. 

Additionally, after doing this process a few dozen times, one begins to acquire a habit of generating 
a plethora of possible solutions at the first sign of a problem or opportunity.  
This is in stark contrast with how the majority of people seem to operate, which could be called having an “idea-deficit”. 

Vision:
The vision of the MindStorm app is twofold:  
The users will have a handy way of practicing this method.  
And, equally importantly, users will have a ready catalog of their ideas that they can then also apply to other 
topics, questions, goals, and problems.
